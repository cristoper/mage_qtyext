= QtyExt

A very simple (no PHP code) Magento extension which adds an item's stock quantity to its extended_attributes available from the REST API.

It basically just uses the "`Search extension attributes`" sample snippet from the official documentation: https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/extension-dev-guide/attributes.html#search

== Installation

Copy the `ONPC/` directory tree to `app/code/` in your Magento root:

```
php bin/magento setup:upgrade
php bin/magento setup:di:compile
```

Minimal resource access required for the API token making the request:

- Category:Inventory:Products
- Stoes:Settings:Configuration:Inventory Section
